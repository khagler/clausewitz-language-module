The Clausewitz engine is used by games from [Paradox Development Studio][2] such as Crusader Kings II and Europa Universalis IV.
This language module simplifies modding these games with BBEdit.

Installation
------------
To install this language module, put the `Clausewitz.plist` file in either `~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules` or in `~/Dropbox/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules`. You'll also need to restart BBEdit if it was already running.
